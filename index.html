      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>Hi I'm Ben Mills! This page is supposed to be a fun, slightly silly guessing game about me. Sorry about all the pop-ups ðŸ˜¬</p>
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
        I studied at Everett Community College and transfered to The University of Washington where I majored in Interdisciplinary Art. More recently I got a Linux certification from the Linux Professional Institute.
      </p>
      <h3>Job Experience</h3>    
      <p>I worked as the manager for a paint your own pottery studio for over a decade.</p>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>I want to change my career from customer service to the tech industry. I love working with Linux and open source software, ideally I'd find a job with a company that is related to the Linux community.
